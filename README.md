# List of necessary resources to land an SDE Job

I have tried to compile all the resources I ever used, to land a job in a Product Based Company, Basically, all the channels listed below have tons of information regarding every aspect of landing a job. I request you to check each and every video of the channels listed below to get an idea of what all they offer, a special mention to **Code for Cause**, as they are helping the community grow in several ways.

### Resume Template
- I personally prefer the [DeedyCV](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/deedy-cv/bjryvfsjdyxz) template, it used LaTeX, so yes we code out our resume here. Other resources for resume are Resumake, Creddle, Canva etc.
- It should be of one page. **Period**.

### Interview Process
#### In my opinion, Interview process goes in decending order of Difficulty
- Any application starts with you applying to the Careers Page, with your resume, I consider this as the **most difficult** round of all, more than 10k+ people at an average apply at a single job opening, therefore getting shortlisted is difficult, one needs a **rockstar resume** to get in.
- If your resume is selected, a Coding Test link is sent to you, Its mostly based on CP, but then again depends upon the comapny, some ask DSA questions too, in my experience mostly String Manipulation / Mathematics Concept Adhoc / Stack Based.
- **One should always read past Interview Experiences of the company you have your Interview scheduled for, it greatly helps in understanding and mapping out a pattern as to what basically they focus upon during the Interview. Some sites to read Interview Experiences are Leetcode Discuss and GeeksforGeeks.**
- 2 or 3 Technical Rounds which can include a Coding Interview(DSA), with OS, DBMS, CN, OOPS, System Design.
- HR or Managerial Round -  Behavioral

**To, all the new grads, preparing for Interviews, one of the most crucial part in the Interview process is the F2F Coding Interview.**

**In the starting, it can be difficult to think beyond a brute force solution that too in a limited period of time. I had the same problem, luckily I came across this platform known as [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/), where we can practice mock interviews with fellows all around the world.**

**It has many different tracks for Interviews like DSA, System Design, Frontend, Behavioural etc. You can even practice with your friends ðŸ’¯**
**This helped me conquer any fears I had before Interviews as I had enough experience of giving it on pramp. Do check it out.**


### What all does a Rockstar Resume have
- **Internships** - Companies look out for people with Internship Experiences as they will already understand the working of the corporate environment. It showcases that an individual has industry level skills.
- **CGPA** - matters alot, specially for Off-Campus opportunities, always try to have at least 8.5+ CGPA.
- **Links** - be it LinkedIn, Github, Codeforces, Leetcode or even a project that you worked upon, always showcase the links of your digital presence on these platforms.
- **Projects** - A good at least has 2-3 Projects made using an Industry level techstack, new technologies, and also a purpose (in mind!) as to why you chose to build this project, what problem does it solve, who does it help, what is the scalability etc.
- **Programming Achievements** - Participate in Coding Challenges of different sites like Leetcode, Codechef, Codeforces, Kickstart, Codejam, this will help you diversify your programming skills and also the ranks play an important role in shortlisting of resume, do take a note of the same.
